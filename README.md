SDA Individual Development Project Report
November 2017

Design:
The idea is to make an android application which shows different types of noodle dishes that you can eat in downtown Stockholm. 
Features:
The noodle objects are stored in a Sqlite database.
The noodles are divided into five categories(Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese).
Each noodle dish is shown with name, description, image, and recommended restaurant in downtown Stockholm.
The user can search for a particular noodle dish or dishes based on name or description. The search results are displayed in alphabetical order.
The user can save his favorite noodles.
The user can share to others through email/message.
