>**About**
- This project was started as an individual assignment from Software Development Academy in November 2017.
It was initially written in Java. After I discovered the beauty of Kotlin, I decided to revisit this school project and rewrote it in Kotlin,
in an ongoing effort of continuous improvement.


>**Design**
- I LOVE noodle soup! Therefore, it would be fun to make an android application which shows different types of noodle dishes that you can eat in downtown Stockholm.

>**Current features:**
- The noodle objects are stored in a SQLite database.
- The noodles are divided into five categories(Japanese, Korean,
  Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese).
- Each noodle dish is shown with name, description, image, and
  recommended restaurant in downtown Stockholm.
- The user can search for a particular noodle dish or dishes based on
  name or description. The search results are displayed in alphabetical
  order.
- The user can save his favorite noodles.
- The user can enter and delete his experience in "My List", which is
  like a quick notepad.
- The user can share to others through email/message (no database
  content).
